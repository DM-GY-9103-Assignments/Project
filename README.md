# Project
## Brainstorming Ideas 
**1. Create a Music Visualizer based on Danceability, Energy and Valence** 

Using Spotify's API, I can create a music visualizer that will change particles and color based on the danceability, energy and valence of the track. This project will require classification to identify the variance between tracks and rely on the track's data to create a visualizer according to the features of the song. To retrieve the song, I will be using Spotify's API to locate the track's features and print the tracks into a database. 

**2. Image Mixer**

Inspired by Lena Weber's work (https://timrodenbroeker.de/lena-weber-ag-cook/), I wanted to manipulate images of flowers from life to death. Although I only have a dataset of live flowers, I want to manipulate the color and pixels of flowers to create a timeline. The shape of the flowers will vary depending on the data provided, however the original colors will be assembled into the shape.
